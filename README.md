# Basics

This codes for an anonymous blogging website, where each user can post a blog with a title and body, which has a author name the user can decide on.

There must be a .env file in thebackend folder which includes the PORT number and a MONGO_URI. the MONGO_URI is the MONGODB connection string for a specific database, given by MongoDB.

Make sure your MongoDB cluster/database works properly and is linked properly. Failure to do this will cause only the title and the POST form on the right to show on screen, without blogs appearing . 

thebackend can be run using "npm run dev"
thefrontend can be run using "npm start"
each command must be used in thier respetive directories/folders.
